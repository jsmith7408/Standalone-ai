# SDT-9 Publication Notes (AI-focused)

## Safe positioning statement

SDT-9 does not propose a physical mechanism or replace existing mathematical or statistical formalisms.  
It provides a discrete coordinate overlay that decomposes symbolic processes into **state**, **scale**, and **transition** components, enabling structural telemetry for AI systems.

## Claims you can make (defensible)

- SDT-9 is a discrete coordinate embedding for symbolic sequences.
- SDT-9 supports deterministic, interpretable telemetry: spoke/pass/travel.
- SDT-9 enables rule-based governance signals (looping, stalling, instability) on agent traces.

## Claims to avoid (will harm adoption)

- Explaining physical reality, consciousness, or causation.
- Replacing probability, gradients, or wave equations.
- Predicting outcomes beyond the underlying model.
